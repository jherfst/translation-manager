### Translation manager  
 
A tool to help and automate the management of translation files in a large scale project, it allows you to import/export multiple formats including PO,CSV,XML (android) and manages the translation files as JSON for the ease of use in most web projects.
 
To see an example, open the file `examples_directory/translation.project.json5` as a collection of projects, or the folder `examples_directory/feature-a` as a project.
